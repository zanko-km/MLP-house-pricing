# House Price Prediction Using Simple Neural Network (MLP)

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **predict house prices** using a **simple neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP)**.  
We use numerical and categorical features of houses to train the model and predict prices accurately. The network employs the **ReLU activation function** in hidden layers to capture non-linear relationships between features and target prices.

## Neural Network & Activation Function

### Neural Network (MLP)
A **neural network** is a computational model inspired by the human brain, composed of **layers of interconnected nodes (neurons)**. Each neuron processes input data and passes it through an activation function to the next layer.  

**MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** is a type of feedforward neural network with one or more hidden layers. It can approximate complex, non-linear functions, making it suitable for regression tasks like house price prediction.

### Activation Function: ReLU
The **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** function is defined as:
ReLU(x) = max(0, x)

- ReLU introduces **non-linearity** to the network, allowing it to model complex patterns.  
- It is computationally efficient and helps avoid the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.

## Dataset Features

> The dataset contains both **numerical and categorical features**, which are preprocessed before feeding into the neural network.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Normalize numerical features  

2. **Model Construction**  
   - Define a simple MLP with input, hidden, and output layers  
   - Use **ReLU activation** in hidden layers  

3. **Training**  
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets  
   - Train the network using backpropagation and optimize loss  

4. **Prediction & Evaluation**  
   - Predict house prices on test data  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **MSE** and **RÂ² score**
